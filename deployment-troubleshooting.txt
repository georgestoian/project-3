1. Pod was restarting.

2. Tried to check the events for this pod with the "kubectl describe pod" command.

3. Identified there was an issue with the liveness probe. From the previous command output, I noticed that the liveness probe was configured to interogate the /nginx_status endpoint. I executed a "kubectl logs" command to gather more information from the application logs.

4. Changed the liveness probe in the apps/hello-world/hello.yml manifest to interrogate the /healthz endpoint and reapplied the yaml file with "./initialize_k8s.sh" script.
